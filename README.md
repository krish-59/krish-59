### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a software developer passionate about solving real-world problems through code. I build cloud-native, real-time systems that connect APIs, sensors, and automation tools — often with a healthy dose of curiosity and caffeine ☕.

- 🌐 Currently building intelligent IoT platforms at **Klynk (Futuristic Labs)**
- 🔁 Comfortable across the stack — backend-heavy, but can touch React when needed
- 🔌 Focused on APIs, automation, and scalable infrastructure
- 🤖 Recently diving deeper into AI workflow orchestration
- ✨ I love making systems smarter, faster, and simpler
